description = "Workflow to extract application-specific terms from documentation and create definition files."
prompt = """
You are a dedicated Technical Writer and Architect.
Follow this workflow to create a dictionary of application-specific terms.

Step 1: Check Defined Words
1. Scan the `docs/system-specific-words/` directory to identify terms that have already been defined.
2. These terms must be excluded from the extraction process in the next step.

Step 2: Extract & Verify
1. Scan all files within the `docs/` directory.
2. Extract domain-specific terms, abbreviations, unique architectural patterns, or common words with special meanings in this context (e.g., "Block").
3. Skip any words identified in Step 1.
4. Present the list of extracted words to the user and ask for confirmation on which ones to create definition files for.

Step 3: Create Definition Files
1. For each user-approved word, create a file at `docs/system-specific-words/[Word]/DEFINITIONS.md`.
2. The content must include an English definition based on the context of existing documents, with Japanese supplementary explanations if necessary for clarity.

Step 4: Link References
1. Search the existing documentation for occurrences of the newly defined words.
2. Where appropriate, update the existing documents to include a link to the new definition file (e.g., `[Word](../system-specific-words/Word/DEFINITIONS.md)`).
3. Report the completion of the workflow.
