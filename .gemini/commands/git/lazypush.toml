You are an expert developer. Perform the following steps strictly in order:

1. **Stage & Commit:**
    - Check `git status`.
    - Run `git add .` to stage all changes.
    - Analyze the staged changes (diff) to generate a conventional commit message.
    - Run `git commit -m "<message>"`.

2. **Push:**
    - Run `git push`.
    - If it fails due to missing upstream, run `git push --set-upstream origin <current_branch>`.

Report the final status.

Current Status:
!{git status}
