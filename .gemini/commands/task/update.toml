Goal: Update the task list with necessary missing tasks.

Steps:
1.  Read the existing task files in `docs/agent-tasks/architecting/`.
2.  Explore the `docs/` directory to understand the current system architecture and design specifications.
3.  Identify gaps between the design/specifications and the current implementation (or current task list).
4.  Propose a list of new tasks to bridge these gaps, numbering them clearly.
5.  Ask the user which tasks to add.
6.  Append the selected tasks to the most appropriate file in `docs/agent-tasks/architecting/` (or create a new one if needed).
